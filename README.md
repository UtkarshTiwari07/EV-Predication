Introduction
The rapid adoption of electric vehicles is a crucial step in combating global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As electric mobility gains popularity, especially through electric two-wheelers, there is an increasing need for sufficient charging infrastructure to support this transition. This project analyzes growth trends of electric scooters in India and estimates the future demand for charging stations in key states.

Objectives
Analyze Growth Trends: Assess the adoption patterns of electric scooters across different Indian states.
Estimate Charging Infrastructure Needs: Predict the future demand for charging stations based on projected growth.
Support Urban Planning: Provide insights for effective resource allocation in transportation systems.
Methodology
The project follows these theoretical steps:

Data Acquisition: Collect historical data on electric scooter registrations from various Indian states.

Data Preparation: Organize and preprocess the data to ensure suitability for analysis.

Predictive Modeling:

Apply statistical methods to model the growth trend of electric scooter adoption.
Use predictive algorithms to forecast future adoption rates over a specified period.
Charging Station Estimation:

Determine the required number of charging stations based on predicted growth.
Utilize parameters like charger capacity to calculate infrastructure needs.
Result Visualization:

Generate graphs and charts to illustrate predicted growth and infrastructure requirements.
Highlight states with the fastest growth and significant infrastructure demands.
Analysis and Interpretation:

Interpret the results to understand the implications for urban planning.
Identify challenges and potential obstacles in developing EV charging infrastructure.
